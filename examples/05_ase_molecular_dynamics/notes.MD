ASE Molecular Dynamics
======================
This example gives a more concrete demonstration of a realistic use case for
ConMan. Here the master generates a series of systems using ase,  which are
then farmed out to the various slaves. The slaves subsequently perform molecular
dynamics simulations on said systems, and return the resulting trajectories.
Finally, the master concatenates all trajectories and saves them to a
`smashing.xyz` file. The final output can be visualised using the command
`ase gui smashing.xyz`.


#####Notes
This code may take a while to run depending on the number of simulations per
slave and system specifications.

This code is intended only as an example and it is not recommended to run any
molecular dynamics simulations in this manner. Furthermore, very large files
such as the trajectories generated by molecular dynamics simulations should
be saved to a known location rather than transferred over sockets.
